            <p class="lead">
              One of the most common questions I get from new customers is: "How often should I actually have my windows cleaned?" It's a fair question — and the honest answer is that it depends on a few things.
            </p>

            <h2>Every 4–8 Weeks for Most Homes</h2>
            <p>
              For the majority of domestic properties in Swindon and the surrounding area, a clean every 4 to 8 weeks is the sweet spot. Regular cleans are much easier to maintain than trying to tackle heavily soiled windows after months of neglect — and your property will always look its best.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of my regular customers are on either a 4-weekly or 8-weekly round. I'll message you the day before so you know when to expect me and can close any windows.
            </p>

            <h2>Factors That Affect How Often You Need a Clean</h2>
            <p>A few things can mean you'll want more frequent visits:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Location near a main road</strong> — traffic pollution and road dust builds up quickly on windows facing busy streets.</li>
              <li><strong>Trees nearby</strong> — pollen, sap, and bird droppings from overhanging trees can make windows look grubby within weeks.</li>
              <li><strong>Coastal or rural areas</strong> — sea spray or agricultural dust can accelerate the need for cleaning.</li>
              <li><strong>Personal preference</strong> — some people simply like their home to look immaculate at all times. Nothing wrong with that!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What About One-Off Cleans?</h2>
            <p>
              If you've just moved into a property, or you're getting ready to sell, a one-off deep clean is a great option. I'm happy to do one-off visits — just get in touch and we can sort something out.
            </p>

            <h2>My Recommendation</h2>
            <p>
              Start with an 8-weekly schedule and see how you feel after a couple of cleans. Most customers find they prefer moving to 4-weekly once they see how much better their home looks with regular maintenance. And of course, if you want to add fascia cleaning or gutter emptying, I can do those at the same time.
