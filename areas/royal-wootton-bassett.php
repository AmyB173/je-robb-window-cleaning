            <p class="lead mt-3">Jack provides regular window cleaning for homes throughout Royal Wootton Bassett. As a one-man business with over 100 customers across Swindon and the surrounding towns, he's built his reputation on doing a proper job and being someone people are happy to have around their property. Every one of his Google reviews is five stars - and that matters more than any sales pitch.</p>
            <!-- [JACK TO CONFIRM] Does Jack have specific RWB customers? If so, replace the generic line below with something like:
            "He already cleans regularly for homes around Templars Firs, Lime Kiln, and the High Street area..." -->
            <p>Jack already works in Royal Wootton Bassett as part of his regular round, so adding new customers in the area is straightforward. He'll message you the day before every clean so you always know when to expect him, and because he's a sole trader, you'll always get the same person turning up - not a different face each time.</p>
            <p>His pure water fed pole system reaches first and second floor windows from the ground without ladders on your property. It leaves glass spotless without any chemicals, and frames and sills get cleaned as part of every visit.</p>

            -->
            <p>Royal Wootton Bassett has a real mix of properties, from the older stone and brick cottages along the High Street and around the church, to the larger modern estates off Coped Hall and around Templars Firs. Each type needs a slightly different approach. Older sash windows and stone surrounds benefit from the gentle pure water clean Jack uses - no harsh chemicals that could damage paintwork or stonework. The newer estates often have a lot of first-floor glass that's difficult to reach, which is where the water-fed pole system really earns its keep.</p>
            <p>Being a market town just off the M4, properties in Royal Wootton Bassett tend to pick up road dust and grime quite quickly, especially on the main road side. Regular cleaning every 8 weeks keeps on top of this and stops dirt building up on frames and seals - which helps your windows last longer as well as look better.</p>

                    Not usually. Jack messages you the day before so you know when to expect him. As long as he can access the windows (side gates unlocked, cars moved if needed), he can clean while you're out and let you know when he's finished. Payment is handled online so there's no need to have cash ready.

                    Rain after a pure water clean is actually fine. Because there's no detergent or chemical residue left on the glass, rainwater just runs off without leaving marks. It's one of the big advantages of the system Jack uses over traditional methods. And in the unlikely event you're not happy with anything after a clean, Jack will come back and sort it at no extra charge.
