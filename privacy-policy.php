          <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #444;">Jack takes your privacy seriously, but he also believes privacy policies shouldn't require a law degree to read. This page explains what information Jack collects, why he collects it, and what he does with it. The short answer: only what's needed to clean your windows and stay in touch with you.</p>

          <!-- 2. What Information Jack Collects -->
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #0a5ca0; margin-top: 2rem;">2. What Information Jack Collects</h3>
          <p>Jack collects the following personal information from customers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Name</strong> - so he knows who he's working for</li>
            <li><strong>Address</strong> - so he knows where to come</li>
            <li><strong>Phone number</strong> - so he can message you the day before each clean and send payment links</li>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> (if provided) - as an alternative way to get in touch</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Jack does not collect or store your payment card details. All payments are handled securely by Stripe (see section 4).</p>
          <p>If you contact Jack through the website contact form, your name, address or postcode, phone number and selected service are collected. If you message Jack on WhatsApp, your phone number and message content are stored within WhatsApp.</p>


          <!-- 3. Why Jack Collects Your Information -->
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #0a5ca0; margin-top: 2rem;">3. Why Jack Collects Your Information</h3>
          <p>Jack uses your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing the window cleaning service (scheduling, access, communication)</li>
            <li>Sending you reminders the day before a clean</li>
            <li>Sending payment links after each clean</li>
            <li>Responding to enquiries and quotes</li>
            <li>Keeping records for business and tax purposes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The legal basis for processing your information is the performance of a contract (i.e. providing the cleaning service you've agreed to) and legitimate interests (i.e. running the business, communicating with customers, and keeping proper records).</p>
          <p>Jack does not use your information for marketing emails, newsletters, or any purpose other than providing and managing the service.</p>


          <!-- 4. Payment and Stripe -->
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #0a5ca0; margin-top: 2rem;">4. Payment and Stripe</h3>
          <p>Payments are processed through Stripe, a secure online payment platform. When you pay via the Stripe link Jack sends you, your card details are entered directly into Stripe's secure system. Jack does not collect, store or have access to your full card details at any point. The Stripe dashboard shows Jack limited information (such as the card type and last 4 digits) for record-keeping purposes only.</p>
          <p>Stripe has its own privacy policy which you can read at <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stripe.com/gb/privacy</a>.</p>


          <!-- 5. Photographs of Completed Work -->
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #0a5ca0; margin-top: 2rem;">5. Photographs of Completed Work</h3>
          <p>Jack regularly photographs completed cleans to share on social media (such as Facebook and Google Business) and on the JE Robb Window Cleaning website. These photos are used to showcase the quality of his work and help potential customers see what to expect.</p>
          <p>Photos will typically show windows, frames, fascias or the exterior of the property. Jack will not include identifiable people in any published photograph without first asking their permission.</p>
          <p>If you would prefer that Jack does not photograph your property, just let him know and he will respect your wishes. You can opt out at any time, and any previously published photos of your property will be removed on request.</p>
          <p>The legal basis for this is legitimate interests (promoting the business). Jack balances this against your rights by ensuring photos do not identify individuals without consent, and by offering an easy opt-out.</p>


          <!-- 6. Who Jack Shares Your Information With -->
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #0a5ca0; margin-top: 2rem;">6. Who Jack Shares Your Information With</h3>

            <li><strong>Stripe</strong> - for processing payments (see section 4)</li>
            <li><strong>EmailJS</strong> - for delivering contact form submissions from the website to Jack</li>
            <li><strong>HMRC</strong> - where required for tax and legal obligations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>That's it. No mailing lists, no data brokers, no advertising networks.</p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #0a5ca0; margin-top: 2rem;">7. How Long Jack Keeps Your Information</h3>

          <p>Financial records (invoices, payment records) are kept for at least 6 years as required by HMRC for tax purposes.</p>
          <p>If you cancel the service and would like your personal details removed, just let Jack know and he will delete everything that isn't required to be kept for legal or tax reasons.</p>
